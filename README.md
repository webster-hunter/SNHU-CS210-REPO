**PROJECT 3 REPO
**
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This program is a simple sales tracker. Given an input file containing a list of items sold, this project will be able to produce a list of all items sold, answer simple queries regarding sales quantities of specific products, and generate a histogram of all items sold.

2. What did you do particularly well?

  I was satisfied with my error mitigatation. While there are relatively few areas that could result in significant issues, I believe that I did well ensuring that there weren't ways in which a user could intentionally break the program. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  For a larger set of data, I believe that an improved search algorithm for both adding items and finding specific items would be a welcome addition. Another significant addition that would need to be made is the ability for the user to input their own files. This restriction was mainly a result of my discomfort integrating Python and C++.
  As a part of recent classes, I have also learned a fair bit of SQL and believe that expanding the program to employ a database to track sales over time would be a massive edition (albeit a bit out of scope for this assignment).

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Coming into this assignment, I had almost no experience integrating Python and C++. While this is obviously an area that will need improvement, I think that my approach here was sound and met what was required. In the future, I will be putting much more effort in learning the details of integration as it will be very useful in future endeavours.

5. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I attempted to make this project as readable as possible by making functions as short as possible and removing as much as I could from main. Similarly, I attempted to make this as adaptable as possible by breaking up the functionality into as many pieces as I could without going overboard. Maintainability is really not a major factor with this project due to it's simplicity, but I believe that many tweaks could be made to improve overall performance.
